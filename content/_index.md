## Welcome to Cavan Pottering Retreat!

We provide (free) accommodation for travelers seeking a break without breaking the bank in (semi-)rural Ireland, in a middle of nowhere town. My friend and I live here, and we have a few spare rooms available. 

It's a great place to while away your time, or '[potter around](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/potter%20around%2Fabout)'.


> Pottering is the act of occupying oneself in a pleasant way but without a definite plan or purpose. 'Pleasant' implies comfort and the lack of a plan implies freedom.
> <sub>(from Pottering: A Cure for Modern Life, Anna McGovern)</sub>

The fundamentals of pottering are: make do with what you've got, don't try too hard, move (a little), keep it local, keep it real (not digital). We hope this retreat lets you experience that. See a [description of an example of pottering around.](activities)

#### What's in Cavan?

365 lakes, us, and not much else. But in all seriousness, [check out a list of recommended activities, you'd be surprised](activities).

#### Is it really free?

Kind of, it's barter: we accept gifts and donations. Gifts can be anything: from a used book or a bottle of whiskey to a piece of furniture or a PlayStation. Maybe it's something you think the house needs, so you can donate after your stay as well. Check out our [guest wishlist](https://www.google.com) for some ideas. You could also help around the house, such as mow the lawn, work on the campervan, or even do some DIY around the house, if you want to!

#### Is this an AirBnB?

This is not an AirBnB, so please do not expect hospitality or services. Think of this as upscale couchsurfing.

#### Is this in the countryside or in an urban area?

Neither, in truth. You can find cows grazing a few meters away from our garden fence but also walk five mins to a KFC. Or you could take a 10-min drive to lakes and forests but take a 10-min bus trip to the local library and arts venue.

#### Why are you doing this?

1. We love the sense of community it creates
2. We wish this retreat existed when we couldn't afford it, and could use it
3. We like serendipity, new friends and... gifts?

#### Is it safe?

The house is in a safe residential area with many families. It's also a minute from the main highway where you can catch an hour-long bus to Dublin city.

We're selective in who we share the retreat with: usually close friends, creative communities and closed groups where we have some acquaintances. Or even better, if you happen to meet us in person and we gave you the link to this page!
