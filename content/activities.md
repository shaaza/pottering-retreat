### Potter around
The number one recommended activity is pottering around, i.e. "to spend time in a relaxed way doing small jobs and other things that are not very important". It is therapeutic, but it's also one of the few things you _can_ do given there's not much around. 

The fundamentals of pottering are: make do with what you've got, don't try too hard, move (a little), keep it local, keep it real (not digital). We hope this retreat creates the mindset for you to potter around.

#### Indoor activities

1. Chill by the **fireplace** under/on a duvet.
2. **Listen to music** on the audio cassette / CD player.
3. **Paint**. We've got canvases, paint and even paint-by-numbers.
4. **Write**. We've got a few writing prompts and poetry games and a desk. And a typewriter-feel keyboard.
5. **Read a book**. We've got a few books and cozy reading spots.
6. **Play video games**. We've got a PlayStation 5 and two controllers.
7. **Make cocktails**. We've got a cocktail making set and a cocktail book.
8. **Cook**. Self-explanatory.
9. **Watch a movie**. We've got a TV and a DVD player (and Netflix too, but that's not as cool).
10. **Hack on electronics**, we've got a [Raspberry Pi starter kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B094J982N4/ref=sspa_dk_detail_3) to learn and play around.
11. **Gardening**. We don't maintain it all that well, but you're welcome to spruce it up.
12. **Nap**. A lot.
13. **Play board games**. You'd need company for that, but we might be free.
14. **Skim through magazines**.
