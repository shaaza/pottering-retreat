### Pottering
The number one recommended activity is pottering, or doing nothing. It is therapeutic, but it's also one of the few things you _can_ do.

#### Can you describe an example of pottering?

> To illustrate the concept, let's take making a cup of tea as an example.
>
> Fill the kettle with water from the kitchen tap. Dock or plug in your kettle. Switch it on and note the cheerines of the 'on' light. Wait for the kettle to boil, noticing the first wisps of steam. Listen to the rumble of the kettle change in tone, wait for the bimetallic strip to do its work and hear the click that signals the water is ready.. 
>
> Pick out a teabag and pop it in a mug. It could be your favourite mug but it doesn't really matter. Pour the water on. Add the right amount of milk for you, then take a teaspoon, squeeze the bag against the side of the mug and in one deft move, flip the teabag into the bin or compost. Stir the tea and tap the teaspoon against the edge of the mug. Don't try to multi-task. Maybe tap your fingers on the countertop.
